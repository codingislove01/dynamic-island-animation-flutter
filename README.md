# Dynamic Island animation in Flutter

## Getting Started

This is an example project showing how to dynamic island animation using Flutter. This was made as part of a youtube tutorial - [Dynamic Island using Flutter | iPhone 14 Pro | Can it be done with Flutter?](https://youtu.be/r-LWrQcXc-M)

The animations are built using implicitly animated widgets in Flutter.

Run it in profile mode to see the animation smoothly

`flutter run --profile`
